	- no full releases for this moment;

## Platforms  <a name="platforms"></a>

### Raspberry Pi 3/Raspbian <a name="rpi3"></a>

#### Prerequirements <a name="rpi3pre"></a>

[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian) OS:  `Raspbian Stretch Lite` or `Raspbian Stretch with desktop` from 2018.11+
 
Configuration with `raspi-config`required:

	- GPU memory 128+ MB required to run Qt with EGLFS(`Advanced Options > A3 Memory Split`);
	- Camera need to be switched ON (`Interfacing Option > P1 Camera`);
	- reboot required to apply changes from above;
	- script `sysXXX.sh` update system and install prerequiremenst, so need to run before using binaries(`/usr/local/bin/sysXXX.sh`). Script build will run it automatically.

#### Qt  <a name="rpi3qt"></a>

Qt 5.12.0 base with EGLFS can be found in [release section](https://github.com/ayaromenok/SDKbuilds/releases/tag/rpi3-v0.1-base)

#### OpenCV <a name="rpi3cv"></a>

OpenCV 4.0.1 with V4L, GStreamer can be found in [release section](https://github.com/ayaromenok/SDKbuilds/releases/tag/rpi3-v0.1-base)
